date: 2018-11-25
activation: 1573819200
version: 0.01 - draft

## Summary

When the median time past [1] of the most recent 11 blocks (MTP-11) is greater than or equal to UNIX timestamp 1573819200, Bitcoin Cash will execute an upgrade of the network consensus rules according to this specification. Starting from the next block these consensus rules changes will take effect:

* Change the Merkle tree structure to Merklix-Metadata Tree.

The following are not consensus changes, but are recommended changes for Bitcoin Cash implementations:

* Automatic replay protection for future upgrade

## Merklix Metadata Tree

The value of the Merkle Root Hash field in the block header will be re-defined as specified in [merklix-metadata.md](merklix-metadata.md).

## Automatic Replay Protection

When the median time past [1] of the most recent 11 blocks (MTP-11) is less than UNIX timestamp 1589544000 (May 15, 2020 upgrade) Bitcoin Cash full nodes MUST enforce the following rule:

 * `forkid` [2] to be equal to 0.

When the median time past [1] of the most recent 11 blocks (MTP-11) is greater than or equal to UNIX timestamp 1589544000 (May 15, 2020 upgrade) Bitcoin Cash full nodes implementing the Nov 15, 2019 consensus rules SHOULD enforce the following change:

 * Update `forkid` [2] to be equal to 0xFF0001.  ForkIDs beginning with 0xFF will be reserved for future protocol upgrades.

This particular consensus rule MUST NOT be implemented by Bitcoin Cash wallet software. Wallets that follow the upgrade should not have to change anything.

## References

[1] Median Time Past is described in [bitcoin.it wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_timestamp). It is guaranteed by consensus trules to be monotonically increasing.

[2] The `forkId` is defined as per the [replay protected sighash](replay-protected-sighash.md) specification.
